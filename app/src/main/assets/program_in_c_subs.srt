00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,520
Ariel listen to me OO languages it's

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,399
a mess. Programming in C is better than

3
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:07,930
anything they've got over there

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,559
The syntax might seem much sweeter.

6
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:15,440
Where objects and subtypes play. But frills like

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,439
inheritance. Will only get in the way.

8
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,720
Admire C's simple landscape. Efficiently

9
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,640
dangerous. No templates or fancy pitfalls...

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,279
...like java and C++!

Program in C

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,320
Pointers, assembly. Manage your memory.

14
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,879
With malloc() and free()

15
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,200
Don't sync your app with runtime plot

16
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,320
Software in C will stay afloat. Do what you

17
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,079
want there. Close to the hardware

18
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,370

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,960
With C all the coders happy,

21
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,640
as it's all procedural

22
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,039
the dudes who .NET ain't happy,

23
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,840
they forgot to call Stream.Dispose().

24
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,400
They like to think they so lucky

25
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,439
the runtime will clean their act. But when you abuse

26
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,560
the memory, you are bottlenecked that's a fact!

27
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,680
Oh well! Program in C!

28
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,080
Program in C!

29
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,640
Nobody's faster. -02's the master,

30
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,880
indubitably!

31
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,439
We what the coders like to roast,

32
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,920
but they don't have a lot to boast!

33
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,000
Pure satisfaction, little abstraction,

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,400
Program in C!

35
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,880
Program in C!

36
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,280
Neither exceptions, nor your contention,

37
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,680
Can't bother me!

38
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,799
Windows and Linux demonstrate.

39
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,600
portable code is running great!

40
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,960
There's implementations, for all occasions!

41
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,550
Program in C!
